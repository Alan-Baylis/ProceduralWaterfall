![Waterfall](WaterfallMovie.gif)

An experimental Unity project of interactive and procedural waterfall simulation. You need [URG-04LX](http://www.hokuyo-aut.jp/02sensor/07scanner/urg_04lx.html) or [UST-10LX](http://www.hokuyo-aut.jp/02sensor/07scanner/ust_10lx_20lx.html) to try the interaction.

Waterfall simulation is based on this [paper](http://www.art-science.org/journal/v4n2/v4n2pp068/artsci-v4n2pp068.pdf) and URG library for Unity is based on this [excellent work](https://github.com/inoook/UnityURG).
